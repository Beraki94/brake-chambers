            A service brake chamber is a single-diaphragm air brake component that converts compressed air pressure into mechanical force for primary braking. It contains one diaphragm, one push-rod, and one pressure housing, no parking spring section.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            When the driver presses the brake pedal, air enters the chamber and pushes the diaphragm against the push-rod. The push-rod transmits force to the slack adjuster and S-cam, applying the brakes. When the pedal is released, an internal return spring retracts the push-rod and releases the brakes.

A spring brake chamber (also called a combination chamber) contains a second internal section with a power spring that acts as an emergency and parking brake. Spring brakes are used where a parking brake is required (drive axles, trailer axles); service brakes are used on steer axles and other non-parking positions.'

            q: 'When should I choose a Long Stroke (LS) service chamber?',
            a: 'Choose a long-stroke service chamber when the vehicle experiences high brake shoe wear rates — usually heavy-duty vocational applications, transit buses, or any vehicle running frequent stop-and-go cycles. Long-stroke chambers provide additional push-rod travel margin, which keeps the slack adjuster in the proper operating range as shoes wear down.'

            q: 'Are these direct replacements for Bendix service chambers?',
            a: 'Yes. BRC service brake chambers are engineered to match the fit, form, and function of Bendix, Haldex, Meritor, Knorr-Bremse, and WABCO service chambers. Use our OEM cross-reference tool to find the exact part number match for your application.'

            q: 'Can I replace a spring brake chamber with a service brake chamber?',
            a: 'No. Service and spring brake chambers are not interchangeable. If a position requires a parking brake function (which it does on drive axles and trailer axles), it must use a spring brake chamber. Service chambers are only used where no parking function is required.'
          },
          {
            q: 'What is a welded clevis service chamber?',
            a: 'A welded clevis service chamber has the clevis permanently welded to the push-rod at the factory, rather than being threaded and secured with a jam nut. Welded clevis designs eliminate the risk of clevis thread pull-out and are common on OE applications. They are not field-adjustable — the push-rod length is fixed.'

          {
            q: 'Can I mix service brake chamber sizes on the same axle?',
            a: 'No. Both sides of an axle must use the same chamber type, stroke, and manufacturer. Mixing sizes causes imbalanced braking, uneven shoe wear, and potential brake pull. Always replace both chambers on an axle at the same time.'
