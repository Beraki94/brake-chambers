          { question: "Why are push-rod threads usually 5/8-11 UNC?", answer: "5/8-11 UNC is the standard push-rod thread size across most North American commercial vehicle brake chambers. It provides adequate clamping force for clevis attachment while remaining compatible with standard clevis yokes. Some European and Japanese applications use metric threads - verify your specific application." },
          { question: "Does a larger OD mean more braking power?", answer: "Not directly. Braking force is determined by the effective diaphragm area (the type number, e.g., Type 30), not the housing outside diameter. Two chambers with the same type number but different ODs deliver the same braking force. OD affects clearance and mounting, not power output." },
          { question: "Can I use a Type 30 service chamber in place of a Type 24?", answer: "No, and you should not try. Type numbers correspond to specific effective diaphragm areas. Substituting a different type changes the force delivered to the slack adjuster, which affects braking balance across the axle. Always match the OEM type number." },
          { question: "Are Type 30/30 and Type 30/30 LS interchangeable?", answer: "No. Standard-stroke and long-stroke chambers have different push-rod travel. Installing the wrong stroke will prevent correct slack adjuster operation. Verify your existing chamber's stroke before ordering." },
          { question: "Do BRC chamber dimensions match Bendix, Haldex, and Meritor?", answer: "Yes. All BRC chambers are dimensioned to SAE J1469 interchangeability standards, so outside diameter, stud centers, and push-rod thread match the OEM part numbers you're replacing. Use our OEM cross-reference tool for a direct part-number match." },

          { question: "Can I replace a standard-stroke chamber with a long-stroke chamber?", answer: "Not on the same axle. Both sides of an axle must use the same stroke type. If you want to upgrade to long-stroke chambers, you must replace all chambers on both sides of the axle and verify your slack adjusters are compatible with long-stroke operation." },
          { question: "How do I measure brake chamber stroke correctly?", answer: "With the brakes fully applied at 90-100 psi, measure the distance from the chamber face to the centerline of the clevis pin. Compare to the CVSA readjustment limit table above. Use a tape measure or a dedicated stroke indicator tool." },
          { question: "Why does my stroke keep increasing even after I adjust the slack adjuster?", answer: "If stroke keeps increasing after manual adjustment, the automatic slack adjuster is likely faulty. ASAs are designed to self-adjust - if it isn't working, manual adjustment only masks the problem. Replace the ASA." },
          { question: "What happens if I drive with stroke out of adjustment?", answer: "If the push-rod cannot travel far enough, the brake will not fully apply. You lose braking power on that wheel, the vehicle pulls to one side, and stopping distance increases dramatically. This is a serious safety issue and an immediate DOT violation." },
          { question: "Do long-stroke brake chambers require different air pressure?", answer: "No. Long-stroke and standard-stroke chambers operate on the same air system pressure (typically 100-120 psi). The difference is stroke travel range, not operating pressure." }

Under braking loads, this weakened section can bend or fail. Always use a hacksaw, cutoff wheel, or band saw for a square, cool cut." },
          { question: "What torque should I use on the mounting nuts?", answer: "For standard 5/8-11 mounting studs, torque to 100-115 ft-lbs (135-155 Nm). Do not over-torque - excessive torque can pull the studs out of the non-pressure housing. Use a calibrated torque wrench." },

        content: "Common questions from fleet managers and technicians choosing the right brake chamber.",
        faqs: [
          { question: "Is a sealed chamber worth the extra cost?", answer: "Yes, for severe-duty applications. Sealed chambers use a sealed housing that prevents dust, mud, and moisture from entering the internal chamber. In dump, logging, refuse, and construction environments, this can double or triple service life compared to standard chambers. For linehaul duty, standard chambers are typically sufficient." },
          { question: "What is a welded clevis assembly?", answer: "A welded clevis assembly is a spring brake chamber where the clevis is factory-welded to the push-rod rather than threaded and jam-nutted. Welded clevis chambers are common on original equipment and eliminate the risk of clevis thread pull-out. They are not field-adjustable - the push-rod length is fixed." },
          { question: "Should I use standard or long-stroke chambers?", answer: "Use long-stroke chambers for transit, coach, and severe stop-and-go applications where brake shoe wear is rapid. Long-stroke chambers provide additional reserve push-rod travel, which keeps the slack adjuster in the proper operating range as shoes wear. Standard-stroke is sufficient for linehaul duty." },
          { question: "When should I upgrade from Type 30/30 to Type 36?", answer: "Upgrade to Type 36 for lowboy, multi-axle, and heavy haul applications where the loaded weight exceeds typical linehaul duty. Type 36 chambers deliver higher clamping force, but also require higher air pressure and larger slack adjusters." },
          { question: "Can I mix different chamber types on the same axle?", answer: "No. Both sides of an axle should have the same chamber type, stroke, and manufacturer. Mixing chamber types on the same axle causes imbalanced braking, uneven shoe wear, and potential brake pull." },
          { question: "How do I choose a chamber for a mixed-fleet operation?", answer: "For mixed fleets, standardize on one or two chamber types used across most vehicles in the fleet. This reduces parts inventory, simplifies training, and allows mechanics to work faster. If your fleet spans both linehaul and severe-duty vocations, use sealed chambers as your universal choice." }

        faqs: [
          { question: "Why is there a tamper-proof band on the rear housing?", answer: "The tamper-resistant band prevents the rear housing from being opened in the field. Under the rear housing, the power spring is compressed with over 2,000 lbs of force. Opening the housing without proper tooling and training can cause the spring to release violently, resulting in serious injury or death. The band is not a suggestion - it is a safety device." },
          { question: "Can I leave a chamber caged permanently?", answer: "No. Caging is a temporary safety procedure for maintenance or towing. Caging permanently disables the emergency/parking brake function of that chamber. Driving a commercial vehicle with a caged spring brake is a serious safety violation and can trigger DOT out-of-service citations." },
          { question: "Can I cage a spring brake without air pressure?", answer: "Yes. That's exactly what mechanical caging is for. Caging works without any air pressure applied. This is why it's used when towing a vehicle that has lost system air - you cage the spring brake to release the parking brakes without needing the air system operational." },
          { question: "How much torque should I apply to the caging nut?", answer: "Do not exceed 35 ft-lbs on the caging nut. Over-tightening can strip the internal aluminum pressure plate, which renders the chamber dangerous and requires full replacement. Use a hand wrench, not an impact wrench." },
          { question: "What should I do if the caging bolt binds?", answer: "Stop immediately. If the caging bolt binds while tightening, the internal spring may be broken, wedged, or misaligned. Forcing the bolt can cause the spring to release violently. Do not attempt to fix this in the field - replace the chamber." },
          { question: "Do I need to cage a spring brake for routine brake shoe inspection?", answer: "Yes, if the vehicle is not connected to an air supply. Caging retracts the push-rod so you can inspect the slack adjuster, S-cam, and shoes without air pressure. Never manually adjust the slack adjuster with the spring brake fully applied." }
